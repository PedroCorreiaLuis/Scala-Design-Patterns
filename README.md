# Scala-Design-Patterns
### My vision of common design patterns in Scala

The goal of this project is to build common design patterns and build them using Scala functional programming.

 Here is a list of those patterns:
 
### Creational design patterns

* Abstract Factory :ballot_box_with_check:
* Builder :ballot_box_with_check:
* Factory Method
* Object Pool
* Prototype
* Singleton

### Structural design patterns
 
* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Private Class Data
* Proxy

### Behavioral design patterns

* Chain of responsibility
* Command
* Interpreter
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Memento
* Null Object
* Observer
* State
* Strategy
* Template method
* Visitor

I Still have to study and learn all those design patters (this might take a while) so all the help is appreciated, if you want to contribute just do a pull request.

If you have more questions or suggestions I am always available **pedrocorreialuis@hotmail.com**
